    about: [
      "Reteki is a dynamic company that offers rental and sales services for devices, catering to both individual consumers and companies. I was tasked with designing the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) for their website and mobile app, creating distinct designs for two target audiences: individuals and businesses. Additionally, I contributed motion graphics designs, which brought the brand's vision to life.",
      'One of the primary challenges was creating two separate designs that provided unique functionalities while maintaining a consistent brand experience. The consumer platform focused on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring a smooth flow from browsing to checkout. For the corporate platform, I developed a more robust system with advanced capabilities, including multi-account management, flexible payment options, and detailed analytics tools.',
      'Throughout the project, I worked closely with the development team to ensure that the design vision was successfully translated into a functional and responsive platform. This collaboration was crucial in optimizing both the front-end and back-end user experience, ensuring the interfaces were both visually appealing and technically sound.',
